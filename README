To add music to this program, you can add a .wav file and uncomment several lines. 

First, put the .wav file in the same folder as this program. Name it something like:
song.wav

Then, where there is a comment that says to add the song file, write it like this:
"song.wav"

Finish uncommenting the lines, and it can play music!
